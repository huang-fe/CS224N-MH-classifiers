I\u2019m honestly not that needy but everyone needs to know that someone will listen at some point. I am appreciative of the fact that you are taking time to hear what I have to say. I wonder what I should do sometimes. I try to tell friends and family that I cannot always be the problem solver, I try to make them see that I deserve a chance to ask advice, to just vent, or to just have a light talk about the weather or a party or something. They don\u2019t seem to hear me. One friend said she thought I was blowing it out of proportion. But that\u2019s the way I feel. What approach would you take if you were me?",
